# Trip-travel-time-calculator

Calculate the total flight time, total layover time, and total travel time for a multi-stage trip

## What it does

This code allows you to setup a trip with several flights that cover multiple time zones and give you your total flight time, total layover time, and total travel time so you don't have to do mental math to know how long the trip will take you

## Setup

Install the requirements.txt and then create a trip for yourself using the [example_main.py](example_main.py)
